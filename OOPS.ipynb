        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data and code. The key principles of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects of that class will have. For example, a Car class could define attributes like color and make, and methods like start() and stop().\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity created from the class blueprint. Each object has its own unique state (values of its attributes) and can perform actions (call its methods). For example, my_car = Car(color='red', make='Toyota') creates an object named my_car from the Car class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It deals with showing \"what\" an object does, not \"how\" it does it.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (the class). It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is a key part of data hiding.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python with names that start and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__). They allow you to define how your objects interact with built-in functions and operators. For example, __init__ is the constructor, and __add__ defines the behavior of the + operator.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or child class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or parent class). This promotes code reuse and establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between classes. For example, a SportsCar class can inherit from a Car class, inheriting its basic properties and adding its own specific ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" In OOP, it refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows a single interface to be used for different underlying data types. A common example is method overriding, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Python does not have strict access modifiers like private or public as in some other languages. Encapsulation is achieved through a convention using naming conventions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Public: Attributes/methods without any leading underscores. They can be accessed from anywhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Protected: Attributes/methods with a single leading underscore (e.g., _attribute). This is a convention to indicate that they should not be accessed from outside the class or its subclasses, but it's not strictly enforced.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Private: Attributes/methods with two leading underscores (e.g., __attribute). Python performs name mangling on these, making them harder to access from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor is a special method used to initialize an object's state. In Python, the constructor is the __init__ method. It is automatically called when a new object of the class is created. It takes the self argument, which refers to the instance being created, and other arguments needed to set the initial state.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Class methods are bound to the class itself, not to an instance of the class. They are defined using the @classmethod decorator and take the class as their first argument (conventionally named cls). They are often used as factory methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Static methods are not bound to either the class or the instance. They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator and do not take self or cls as their first argument. They are essentially regular functions that are logically grouped with the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but with different numbers or types of parameters. Python does not support method overloading directly in the traditional sense. If you define multiple methods with the same name, the last one defined will override the previous ones. You can achieve similar functionality using default arguments, variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs), or function dispatchers.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding is a feature of inheritance where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows a child class to change the behavior of an inherited method while keeping the same method signature.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The @property decorator is used to define \"getters,\" \"setters,\" and \"deleters\" for class attributes. It allows you to use a method as an attribute, providing a cleaner way to manage access to a class's internal state. This helps in implementing encapsulation by allowing you to add validation logic or other operations when an attribute is accessed or modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is crucial for writing flexible and reusable code. It allows you to design generic interfaces that can work with a variety of data types. For example, you can write a function that takes a list of different types of shapes (e.g., Circle, Square) and calls their respective draw() method, without needing to know the specific type of each shape. This makes the code more extensible and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own. Its purpose is to serve as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes can contain abstract methods, which are methods that have a declaration but no implementation. Subclasses are required to provide an implementation for these abstract methods. In Python, the abc (Abstract Base Classes) module is used to create abstract classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Modularity: Code is organized into self-contained units (objects).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Reusability: Inheritance allows for code reuse, reducing redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Flexibility: Polymorphism allows for flexible and extensible code.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Maintainability: Encapsulation and abstraction make the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Security: Encapsulation helps in data hiding, protecting data from unauthorized access.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class variables are shared by all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside of any method. They are accessed using ClassName.variable_name.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Instance variables are unique to each instance of a class. They are defined inside a method (usually __init__) and are specific to that object. They are accessed using self.variable_name.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This means the child class inherits attributes and methods from all its parent classes. While powerful, it can lead to complexity and the \"diamond problem\" where a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor, causing ambiguity in method resolution.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "- __str__ is a dunder method that provides a user-friendly string representation of an object. It's what is returned when you use print() or str() on an object. The goal is to be readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "- __repr__ is a dunder method that provides an \"official\" string representation of an object. Its goal is to be unambiguous and to ideally be a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate the object. It's often used for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "- The super() function is used to call a method from the parent class. In the context of inheritance, it is most commonly used in the __init__ method of a subclass to call the parent class's __init__ method, ensuring that the parent's attributes are properly initialized. It's also essential for resolving method calls in complex inheritance hierarchies.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method is a destructor. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., its reference count drops to zero). It's primarily used for cleaning up resources, such as closing files or network connections. However, it is not recommended to rely on __del__ for resource management as Python's garbage collection is non-deterministic.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- @staticmethod is a decorator for a method that does not need access to the class or the instance. It's a way to group a utility function logically with a class. It does not take self or cls as its first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "- @classmethod is a decorator for a method that receives the class itself (cls) as the first argument. It is used when a method needs to operate on the class or create instances of the class, such as a factory method.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Polymorphism works because a child class can change a method it inherits from its parent. This means different objects can have different behaviors even when called with the same method name.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining is when you call multiple methods on the same object in a single line. This is possible when each method returns the object itself, allowing you to link calls together.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method allows an object to be used like a function. If you have an object with this method, you can put parentheses after it and execute its code."
